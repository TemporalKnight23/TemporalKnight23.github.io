		<h1> Chicken Enchiladas with Red Enchiladas Sauce </h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<h3> Ingredients </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> 2&frac12; cups Red Enchiladas Sauce </li>
			<li> 1 tablespoon vegetable or canola oil </li>
			<li> &frac12; cup finely chopped sweet onion </li>
			<li> 2 tablespoons diced canned green chiles, drained and rinsed </li>
			<li> 1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
			<li> 2 cups shredded cooked chicken </li>
			<li> 1&frac12; cups finely shredded Monterey Jack cheese </li>
			<li> Twelve 6 inch corn tortillas <i>(I like to use 8in flour tortillas)</i></li>
          <li> 1 cup finely shredded mild Cheddar cheese </li>
        </ul>
      <h3> Directions </h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Coat the inside of a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray and spread &frac13; cup of the sauce over the bottom of the pan. </li>
          <li> Heat the oil in a small saut&eacute; pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, chiles and cumin and saut&eacute; until the onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken and toss in the mix to coat. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and allow to cool slightly. Stir in 1 cup of the Monterey Jack cheese. </li>
          <li> Dip a tortilla into the sauce to soften it. Place the softened tortilla on a flat surface and spread about &frac14; cup of the chicken filling in the center of the tortilla. Roll up the tortilla and place seam side down on the top of the sauce in the prepared dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spread the remaining sauce over the enchiladas and cover with the remaining &frac12; cup Monterey Jack cheese and Cheddar cheese.</li>
         </ol>
       <h3> Baking </h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.</li>
      <li> Bake the casserole for 25 to 30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and turning golden brown.</li>
